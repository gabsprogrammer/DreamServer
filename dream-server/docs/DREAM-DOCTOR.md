# Dream Doctor

Diagnostics command for DreamServer installation and runtime health checks.

## Usage

### Via dream-cli (Recommended)

```bash
# Run diagnostics with operator-friendly output
dream doctor

# Get raw JSON report
dream doctor --json

# Save report to custom location
dream doctor --report /path/to/report.json
```

### Direct Script Invocation

```bash
scripts/dream-doctor.sh
scripts/dream-doctor.sh /tmp/custom-dream-doctor.json
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Run diagnostics with operator-friendly output
.\dream.ps1 doctor

# Get raw JSON report
.\dream.ps1 doctor --json

# Save report to a custom location
.\dream.ps1 doctor --report C:\Users\you\Desktop\dream-doctor.json
```

Windows also keeps `.\dream.ps1 report` as the shareable support bundle command.
`doctor` is the quick readiness diagnosis; `report` is the larger artifact bundle.

## Output

- ✗ Red: Failures/blockers

Example output:
```
━━━ Dream Server Diagnostics ━━━

Runtime Environment:
  ✓ Docker CLI
  ✓ Docker Daemon
  ✓ Docker Compose
  ✗ Dashboard HTTP
  ✗ WebUI HTTP
  ⚠ DGX Spark llama-server CUDA arch: DGX Spark detected, but llama-server reports CUDA archs '500,610,700,750,800,860,890,1200' without sm_121.

Installation Files:
  ✓ .env
  ✓ model file: Qwen3.5-9B-Q4_K_M.gguf
  ✓ writable install/model directories

Compose and Images:
  ✓ compose config
  ✓ images resolvable: 8/8

Preflight Checks:
  ✓ RAM: 16GB available
  ⚠ Disk: 50GB available (recommended: 100GB)
  ✓ GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4090 detected

Summary:
  ⚠ 1 warning(s) found

Suggested Fixes:
  1. Free up disk space or add external storage
```

### JSON Mode

Raw machine-readable report for automation:
```bash
dream doctor --json > report.json
```

## Report Contents

- **capability_profile**: Hardware detection snapshot
- **preflight**: Blocker/warning analysis
- **runtime**: Docker/Compose/UI reachability checks
- **runtime.dgx_spark_cuda_arch_check**: Warns when a DGX Spark / GB10
  machine is running a llama.cpp CUDA binary that does not report `sm_121`
  support in `llama-server` logs.
- **install**: `.env`, required key, model file, and writable directory checks
- **compose**: resolved compose flags, `docker compose config` status, and image
  availability from `docker compose config --images`
- **ports** (Windows): local TCP listener checks for the primary DreamServer ports
- **health** (Windows): HTTP checks for LLM, Open WebUI, dashboard, and dashboard API
- **summary**: Aggregate status (blockers, warnings, runtime_ready)
- **autofix_hints**: Prioritized remediation actions

By default, Linux/macOS doctor checks remote Docker manifests for images
discovered from compose when the Docker daemon is available. Set
`DREAM_DOCTOR_IMAGE_MANIFEST=0` to keep the report fully local/offline and skip
remote manifest probes.

## Exit Codes

- `0`: All checks passed (or warnings only)
- `1`: Blockers found or runtime failures detected

Use in scripts:
```bash
if dream doctor; then
    echo "System healthy"
else
    echo "Issues detected, check output"
fi
```

## Integration

The doctor command integrates with:
- `scripts/build-capability-profile.sh` - Hardware detection
- `scripts/preflight-engine.sh` - Requirement validation
- Service registry - Port resolution

## Default Report Path

`/tmp/dream-doctor-report.json`
