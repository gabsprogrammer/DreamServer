# Contributing to Dream Server

Thanks for building with us.

## Fast Path

If you want to add or extend services, start here:
- [docs/EXTENSIONS.md](docs/EXTENSIONS.md) — extending services (Docker containers, dashboards)
- [docs/INSTALLER-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/INSTALLER-ARCHITECTURE.md) — modding the installer itself

That guide includes a practical "add a service in 30 minutes" path with templates and checks.

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue with:
- hardware details (GPU, RAM, OS)
- expected behavior
- actual behavior
- relevant logs (`docker compose logs`)

## Pull Requests

1. Fork and create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-change`)
2. Keep PR scope focused (one milestone-sized change)
3. Run validation locally
4. Submit PR with clear description, impact, and test evidence

## Contributor Validation Checklist

The fastest way to validate everything:
```bash
make gate    # lint + test + smoke + simulate
```

Or run individual steps:
```bash
make lint    # Shell syntax + Python compile checks
make test    # Tier map unit tests + installer contracts
make smoke   # Platform smoke tests
```

Full manual checklist:
```bash
# Shell/API checks
bash -n install.sh install-core.sh installers/lib/*.sh installers/phases/*.sh scripts/*.sh tests/*.sh 2>/dev/null || true
python3 -m py_compile dashboard-api/main.py dashboard-api/agent_monitor.py

# Unit tests
bash tests/test-tier-map.sh

# Integration/smoke checks
bash tests/integration-test.sh
bash tests/smoke/linux-amd.sh
bash tests/smoke/linux-nvidia.sh
bash tests/smoke/wsl-logic.sh
bash tests/smoke/macos-dispatch.sh
```

If your change touches dashboard frontend and Node is available:
```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Current Priorities

These are the things we most need help with, in order of impact:

1. **Model switching UI** — let users swap models from the dashboard without reinstalling or touching the CLI. The backend (`dream model swap`) exists; the frontend doesn't.
2. **Bun website installer** — a one-click install experience from the website. This is a greenfield project — talk to us before starting.
3. **Dashboard theming** — customizable color themes so users can make the dashboard their own. CSS variables, theme picker, preset themes.
4. **Extensions reliability** — manifest validation, health check coverage, dependency resolution. The foundation is in; keep hardening it.
5. **Multi-GPU utilization** — we detect multiple GPUs but don't split work across them yet.

If you want to tackle any of these, open an issue first so we can align on approach.

## What We'll Merge Fast

- Bug fixes with reproduction steps
- Tests for existing untested code paths
- Focused, single-concern PRs that do one thing well
- Platform support (new OS, new GPU vendor, new hardware tier)
- Security fixes with clear explanation of the vulnerability

## What Will Get Bounced Back

We've learned these patterns the hard way. Save yourself a review cycle:

- **Mega-PRs that bundle unrelated changes.** One PR = one concern. A bug fix + a feature + a refactor = three PRs.
- **Code that wasn't run.** If your function is called but never defined, or your shell variable won't expand in that context, we'll catch it. Run your code locally before submitting.
- **Breaking changes without migration.** Changing port defaults, tightening schemas, broadening volume mounts — these all need migration notes and maintainer discussion first. Open an issue before the PR.
- **Tests for features that don't exist.** A test suite that skip()'s every check because the underlying feature isn't implemented gives false confidence. Write the tests alongside the feature.
- **Formatting-only PRs.** We appreciate clean code, but a PR that only runs black/prettier across the codebase creates merge conflicts for everyone else and adds no functionality.
- **Over-engineering.** If the problem is simple, the solution should be simple. Don't add configuration, abstraction layers, or feature flags for one-time operations.

## Style

- Bash: `set -euo pipefail`, quote your variables, use `shellcheck`
- Python: match the style of the file you're editing, no reformatting unrelated code
- YAML/JSON: stable keys, minimal noise, no tabs
- Docs: concrete commands and compatibility notes
- Commits: short imperative subject line, explain *why* not *what* in the body

## Questions

Open an issue or start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer/discussions). Include enough context to reproduce the problem quickly. We're happy to help you figure out the right approach before you write code — it's much faster than reviewing a PR that needs a redesign.
